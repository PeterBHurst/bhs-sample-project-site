    <h2>My first Snap Project</h2>
    <p>SKATE-O-MATIC was a game that my partner parker and I tried to make. We were making it for the national congressional app chanlenge. The idea behind the project was to make an adventure RPQ type game that would teach you about skateboarding and some essential knowledge you might need to know. "</p>
